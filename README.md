Hello! My name is Ethan Sirois. I'm a sophomore at UIUC studying Mathematics & Computer Science. 

I am interested in many fields of computer science, but the fields that I have been most interested in recently are artificial intelligence and compilers. Designing compilers that are specifically optimized for artificial intelligence is especially interesting to me, and it's something I hope to start exploring soon.
