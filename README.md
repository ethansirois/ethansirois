Hello, my name is Ethan Sirois. I'm a sophomore at UIUC studying mathematics with a minor in computer science. 

I am interested in many fields of computer science, however the fields that I have been most interested in recently are artificial intelligence and compilers. Designing compilers that are optimized for artificial intelligence specifically is extra interesting to me, and something I hope to start exploring soon.
